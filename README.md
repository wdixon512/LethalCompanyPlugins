# How to Use
1. Install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore_mod_manager)
2. Download the files in this repository as a .zip
3. Extract the .zip into the following location on your PC: `%appdata%\Thunderstore Mod Manager\DataFolder\LethalCompany\profiles\Default\`
    1. On Windows PCs, hit the Windows key then type `Run`. In the small window that pops up, type `%appdata%`. That will take you to your appdata folder referenced above
    2. **Recommendation**: You can make a new folder in the `...\profiles\...` folder (e.g. `\profiles\Friend Plugins\` if you want to separate your default/plugin profiles in Thunderstore Mod Manager. You would then extract the files from the .zip into _that_ folder instead.
    3. If you decide to have a separate plugin profile, in Thunderstore Mod Manager, after you select `Lethal Company` as your game, click the `Change profile` button at the top:
